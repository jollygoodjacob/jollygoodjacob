## About Me
I’m a Ph.D. Candidate in the Environmental Systems Graduate Group at the University of California, Merced. I conduct research in the Earth Observation and Remote Sensing (EORS) Lab (PI: Dr. Erin Hestir). When I'm not coding or field sampling, you can find me hiking, catching waves, or playing the guitar.

## Research Focus

My dissertation research leverages multi-scale remote sensing — from satellites, drones, and aircraft — combined with in-situ biodiversity surveys and environmental DNA (eDNA) from soils, sediments, and water. Together, these datasets help me assess, monitor, and model biodiversity across dynamic terrestrial–aquatic interfaces.

### Biodiversity at the Terrestrial-Aquatic Interface
I am especially interested in how hydrology and geomorphology shape biodiversity and ecosystem services, focusing on floodplains, river corridors, and ephemeral wetlands — the transitional zones where life and water converge.

### Spatiotemporal Data Fusion
A growing area of my research involves spatiotemporal data fusion, particularly for combining satellite and UAV imagery to generate synthetic fine-resolution time series. These approaches have applications in precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, and other domains where high spatial and temporal resolution are essential.

### Open Science and Tools

I’m a strong advocate for open-source geospatial science and reproducible research.
I primarily code in R and Python, and frequently use QGIS, Google Earth Engine, and GDAL within my workflows. I also use JavaScript and Bash for specialized geospatial automation tasks.
